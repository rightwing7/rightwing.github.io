<h1>The Modern Conservative Site </h1>
  <p> This a website based on facts and opinions that are protect under the first amendment. </p>
  <p>  We have to start with the basics before anything. </p>
<p> By now you must know about the left wing and the right wing. The left wing is taken over Democrats and the right wing is taken over by Republicans.  </p>
  <p>  The Democratic Party (considered the left wing) has different types of groups but becasue they agree about many similiar issues and have a similiar perspectives that fall into the same party.Below theres a list of the different groups that exsit in the Democrati Part. </p>
<p>	1.Centrist wing - Someone that is against big political changes with moden views of politics as well. Its important to know they can be part of the Left wing or Right wing.  </p>
<p> 2. Conservative wing - Individuals who "believe in personal responsibility, limited government, free markets, individual liberty, traditional American values and a strong national defense."</p> 
<p> 3. Liberal wing - Part of the definiton of is "more tolerant to change" and the complete oppotise of conservatives. </p>
<p> 4. Libertarian wing - "collection of political philosophies and movements that uphold liberty as a core principle... seek to maximize political freedom and autonomy, emphasizing freedom of choice, voluntary association and individual judgment." </p>
<p> 5. Progressive wing - Based on the Progressive Era in the 20th  and support for advocacy. </p>
<p> 6.Social democratic and democratic socialist wings - "Democratic socialism is a political philosophy that advocates democracy alongside direct social ownership of the means of production, with an emphasis on self-management and democratic management of economic institutions within a market or some form of decentralized planned socialist economy." </p>

  <p> The Republican Party also has different groups. And again </p> 
  <p> 1. Conservative Wing -  Individuals who "believe in personal responsibility, limited government, free markets, individual liberty, traditional American values and a strong national defense."</p>
  <p  2. Moderate Wing - People that dont consider themselves "neither extreme left-wing politics nor extreme right-wing politics." </p>
  <p> 3. Libertarian Wing - "collection of political philosophies and movements that uphold liberty as a core principle... seek to maximize political freedom and autonomy, emphasizing freedom of choice, voluntary association and individual judgment." </P>
  <p> Beccause the differnt groups still mean the same thing the only difference is whether they are Republicans or Democrats. To be a Rublican means wanting the best for the government economically even though often times Republicans are labelled as racist and just the evil party but thats not the truth. However like any other group it does have Republicans that say some of the most outrages things - and so people label the whole party as bad over one person's comments. But for some reason Democrats have turned into the good guys all of a sudden. All because in our history classes we learned that the Democratic and Republican Party switched beliefs. But thats not the truth- according to Carol Swain, professor of Political Science and Law at the University of Vanderbilt, since 1829 the Democratic Party justified and defended slavery, and because of their defense for slavery they started the Civil War, founded the KKK, and forced segregation - who are the real racist now? Not to mention that Hillary Clinton among other political figure or members of congress like Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez have talked to African American with a southern accent. Which in my opinion is beyond racist, its assuming that African Americans are stupid and trust me they aren't. In contrast the Republican party was founded in 1854 as a anti-slavery party that wanted to abolish slavery.   </p> 
  <p> Lately conservatives have been attacked more brutally than ever, young conservatives are afraid to even speak out because of fear of the left side attacking them as racist or even homophobic. Conservatives like Milo Yiannopoulos, Ben Shapiro, Steven Crowder, Candence Owens have all had death threats, shootings or bomb threats at their talks in college campusses because of how much the extreme left just does not agree with anyone from the right. With Democrats is that someone always has to be a victim - yet they don't help you they wont do anything to make your life better, the only thing you get is first place for the most opprossed. Conservatives rights to free speech are being violated, why do conservatives have to be banned from social media just because the mojority of the public doenst agree with it but terrorist or people that threaten to kill someone is just fine, right? Accoring to the left. Disappointing. </p>

  <p> Debate has heated up between Republicans and Democrats because of the new abortion laws. I mean lets face is abortion is morally wrong -  incist and rape cases make up a very small portion of the over all use of abortion. Many were outraged becasue of the new Alabama abortion law - most were very violent and quick to label senetors of Alabama. But in reality abortion is such a complex issue especially becasue the left always wants to bring in the case of foster care system but heres the truth the foster care system is mostly contained of children that have been taken out of their homes because their families have grown to be abusive to them or just cant sutain them anymore. Babie given to adoption most of the time are adopted a lot faster than older kids because they are newborns and couples that cant have babies of their own still want that feeling of a new baby. Sad but true. Adoption is always an option. This is not a womens right issue - it's an issue of all lives matter. The reason that birth control was even invented was to control the "black population" - Democrats are planting this idea that the most oppresed you are the more you are the victim. They scream socialism but dare to define it as something else thats not the realty. The history of Democrats is so hidden and unknown.   </p>
